Ambit Stochastics
=================

A collection of numerical codes to help perform simulations of ambit fields.

We are working towards providing a library of useful
C-codes. Currently, the project is very much in its infancy as we
experiment and explore. Be therefore warned that the project in its
current state is not of much use for people outside of out little
group at Aarhus University.
